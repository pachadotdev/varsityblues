You can delete all the lines starting with "#" in the header, also you can

The {#rmd-basics} text after the chapter declaration will allow us to link 
throughout the document back to the beginning of Chapter 1.  These labels will 
automatically be generated (if not specified) by changing the spaces to hyphens 
and capital letters to lowercase.  Look for the reference to this label at the 
beginning of Chapter 2.
